# Python environment

The `antiyoy_rl` package is a thin NumPy boundary over the authoritative Rust
batch environment. It releases the Python GIL during parallel stepping and
returns structure-of-arrays buffers instead of Python objects per hex or action.

## Development install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install maturin==1.15.0 pytest numpy
cd python
../.venv/bin/maturin develop --release
../.venv/bin/pytest -q tests
```

## Minimal loop

```python
import numpy as np

from antiyoy_rl import VectorEnv

environment = VectorEnv(256, width=11, height=9, seed=1)
observation = environment.observe()
action_indices = np.zeros(environment.environments, dtype=np.uint64)
result = environment.step(action_indices)
```

Each action index is local to its environment's half-open range in
`observation["action_offsets"]`. Select a legal action, step the complete batch,
and reset every environment whose terminal or truncated value is one.
